My name is Atilay Kucukoglu. I am a researcher and music technologist originally from Istanbul, Turkey, now based in New York. My passion lies at the intersection of music and technology, a journey that has taken me from being a guitarist to a researcher focused on the future of audio.  
\\
My path began as a guitarist and producer in Istanbul. I earned my B.A. in Music from Istanbul Bilgi University, where I built a strong foundation in music theory, composition, and production while working as a freelance engineer.  
\\
This hands-on experience led me to pursue a master's degree in Sound Engineering & Design at Istanbul Technical Universityâ€™s Center for Advanced Studies in Music (MIAM), the leading program for audio engineering in Turkey. An elective in Audio Programming there sparked my passion for research, introducing me to MIR, machine learning, and development communities like ISMIR and NIME.  
\\
This new focus motivated me to come to NYU, where I have been able to study Digital Signal Processing, MIR, and Deep Learning with world-class faculty.

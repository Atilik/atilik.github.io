I'm from Istanbul, Turkey. I completed my undergraduate study in music where I learned extensive music theory, tonal harmony, music composition, electronic music, music history, and form analysis. Around that time I was interested in sound engineering and music production. I did many productions, arrangements, and recordings with many talented musicians across a wide range of genres.
After I completed my undergraduate studies I continued to study for a master's degree in Istanbul Technical University's Advanced Studies in Music.

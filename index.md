- My **research interests** are controllability in music generation, music information retrieval, music generation system design, evaluation methods for music generation systems, and user music preference modeling.  
- I'm writing my master's thesis **"Music User Preference Modeling for Controlling Music Generation"** where I explore novel methods to control music generation models through user listening history data.
- I also have a **background in music composition and sound engineering**. 
- You can check more of my [**research**](/projects/) and [**publications**](/publications/).

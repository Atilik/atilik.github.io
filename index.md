- I’m a **Graduate Research Assistant at NYU’s Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL)** supervised by Dr. Magdalena Fuentes.
- I'm also a 2nd year master's student in NYU Steinhardt's Music Technology program, writing my thesis "Music User Preference Modeling for Controlling Music Generation" where I explore novel methods to control music generation models through user listening history data.
- My research interests are controllability for human–AI music systems, music information retrieval, evaluation methods for music-generation systems, user music preference modeling.
